# AI Collaboration Guidelines

This document provides tips and best practices for collaborating with Cursor AI within this specific project template.

## General Tips

- **Be Specific:** Clearly state what you want the AI to do. Vague requests lead to vague results.
- **Provide Context:** Ensure Cursor has the relevant files open or attached. Mention specific files, components, or functions involved.
- **Break Down Tasks:** For complex features, divide the request into smaller, logical steps. Use the `steps/FEATURE_TEMPLATE.md` to structure your request.
- **Review Changes:** Always review the code generated by the AI. It's a powerful tool, but not infallible.
- **Use `.cursorrules`:** Cursor reads the `.cursorrules` file for project-specific instructions. Familiarize yourself with it.
- **Iterate:** If the first attempt isn't perfect, provide feedback and ask for refinements. "This is close, but can you also..." or "Please change X to Y."

## Working with Components (Shadcn UI)

- **Specify Shadcn:** When requesting UI elements, explicitly mention using Shadcn UI components (e.g., "Add a Shadcn Button", "Create a form using Shadcn Input and Label").
- **Check Imports:** Ensure imports for Shadcn components use the correct alias: `@/components/ui/...`.
- **Customization:** If you need customization beyond basic props, ask the AI to apply Tailwind utility classes directly or guide it on how to modify the component's structure if necessary (though prefer composition).

## Routing

- **Mention React Router:** Specify that routing is handled by `react-router-dom`.
- **Target `App.tsx`:** For adding or modifying routes, point the AI to `src/App.tsx` and the `<Layout>` wrapper.
- **Linking:** Request links using the `<Link>` component from `react-router-dom`.

## Styling

- **Prefer Tailwind:** Instruct the AI to use Tailwind utility classes for styling.
- **Use `clsx` / `tailwind-merge`:** For conditional or combined classes, remind the AI to use these utilities if it forgets.

## State Management

- **Default to Hooks:** Assume standard React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) are sufficient unless the complexity warrants global state.
- **Ask for Global State:** If global state is needed, explicitly request it and discuss options (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) before implementation.

## Using Step Templates

- Copy the content of a template from the `steps/` directory (e.g., `FEATURE_TEMPLATE.md`).
- Fill in the details for your request.
- Paste the filled template into your chat message to Cursor.

By following these guidelines, you can leverage Cursor more effectively within this template, leading to faster development and more consistent code.
