# Planning Phase:

Create an implementation plan for building a React TypeScript [feature] component that [description]. Include the component structure, hooks needed, and potential edge cases to address.

# Implementation Phase:

Implement step 1 of the plan you just created, focusing only on this step.

# Structured Problem-Solving Template

For debugging and feature implementation:
I need to implement [feature] in our React TypeScript SPA.

First, analyze the current project structure and any similar implementations. Provide your OBSERVATIONS based on the codebase.

Then, present your REASONING for the approach you'll take, considering our established patterns and TypeScript best practices.

Finally, create a detailed PLAN before implementing, breaking down the solution into clear steps.

# Creating a New Feature:

Create a new feature called UserProfile that displays user information and allows editing. The feature should use the Zustand store for state management, Shadcn UI components for the interface, and implement proper form validation with Zod. Reference our existing AuthForm component for styling patterns.

# Refactoring Legacy Code:

Refactor this class-based component to use functional components and hooks. Implement proper TypeScript typing, extract reusable logic into custom hooks, and ensure performance optimization with proper memoization.

# Debugging

Debug the issue in our DataTable component where sorting isn't working correctly. First analyze the current implementation, provide your observations about potential issues, explain your reasoning, and then implement a solution that maintains TypeScript type safety.
